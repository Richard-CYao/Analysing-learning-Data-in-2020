# Analysing-learning-Data-in-2020
I download these data from kaggle in a folder named Learning Data. However, I do not upload this folder to GitHub because the files are too large and too many. 
If you want, you can download data from this URL: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/learnplatform-covid19-impact-on-digital-learning/overview

These data are mainly divided into three:

*   **The engagement_data** folder is about a set of daily edtech engagement data from over 200 school districts in 2020.

*   **The products_info** file includes information about the characteristics of the top 372 products with most users in 2020.

*   **The districts_info** file includes information about the characteristics of school districts, including data from NCES and FCC.
